## 3. Reflection — Grounded in Your Git History

> **Rules:** Every answer below **must include a direct link** to the specific commit, PR, issue, or branch in your repository that demonstrates what you are describing. Answers without working links will not be graded. Generic explanations that could apply to any project will receive zero marks.
>
> **Marks:** A (2 marks) · B (1 mark) · C (1 mark) · D (1 mark) = **5 marks total**

### A. Your Best Commit

Paste the URL of the commit in your history that you think best demonstrates clean conventional commit practice (good type tag, clear subject, meaningful body or footer).

- **Commit URL:** (https://github.com/IS-PROJECT-2026/academic-tracker-166991/commit/28347b35407bf06e6f3f579b569b6c9b941c87a7)
- **Why this one?** This commit uses a clear `fix` type with a scoped subject line under 50 characters.

### B. A Mistake or Struggle

Link to a commit, PR, or issue where something went wrong — a bad commit message you had to fix, a branch you had to delete and recreate, a PR that needed rework, or a deployment that broke. 

- **Link to the evidence:** https://github.com/IS-PROJECT-2026/academic-tracker-166991/commit/08219a272b0abf2e963d76296695db79abf9480c
- **What happened and how did you recover?** I declared `loadCourses()` above `STORAGE_KEY` and its helper functions, causing a "Cannot access before initialization" error that silently broke data persistence on page refresh. I reordered the declarations so `STORAGE_KEY`, `saveCourses`, and `loadCourses` were defined before use.

### C. A Pull Request You're Proud Of

Paste the URL of the PR that best shows your self-review process — one where the description is clear, the issue linkage is correct, and the diff tells a coherent story.

- **PR URL:** (https://github.com/IS-PROJECT-2026/academic-tracker-166991/pull/12)
- **What did you check before merging?** Before merging, I confirmed the GPA calculation logic, table rendering, and form-wiring were split into three distinct, individually reviewable commits rather than one large change, and manually tested the GPA calculation against known grade and credit combinations before merging.

### D. One Thing You Would Do Differently

If you had to restart this project from scratch with everything you know now, name one specific workflow decision you would change (not a code change — a Git/project management decision).

- **What would you change?** I would run the three required merge conflict exercises earlier in the week instead of leaving them until the end, since debugging an unexpected file-encoding issue — PowerShell's `echo` command creating UTF-16 files that Git treated as binary — cost me unneccessary time and frustration.
- **Link to the evidence of the original decision:** https://github.com/IS-PROJECT-2026/academic-tracker-166991/pull/17

## 4. Screenshots of Key GitHub Features

Demonstrate your workflow mechanics by embedding your screenshots below.

> **CRITICAL FOR WORKING IMAGES:** Do not type manual folder paths. Edit this file directly on the GitHub web interface, click on the blank line below each prompt, and **paste (Ctrl+V / Cmd+V)** your screenshot. GitHub will automatically upload the file and generate a permanent, working image link for you.

### A. Milestones and Issues
*Provide a screenshot showing your active milestone(s) and the granular tracking issues linked directly to them.*

[PASTE YOUR MILESTONE SCREENSHOT DIRECTLY HERE]

* **Caption:** [Write a brief sentence describing your milestones here]

### B. Project Board
*Provide a screenshot of your GitHub Project Board with your issues organized dynamically across columns (To Do, In Progress, Done).*

[PASTE YOUR PROJECT BOARD SCREENSHOT DIRECTLY HERE]

* **Caption:** [Write a brief sentence describing your board state here]

### C. Branching Architecture
*Provide a screenshot showing your local or remote Git branch list, highlighting your use of conventional, issue-linked naming patterns (e.g., `feat/`, `fix/`, `style/`).*

[PASTE YOUR BRANCHING SCREENSHOT DIRECTLY HERE]

* **Caption:** [Write a brief sentence describing your branch list here]

### D. Pull Requests & Traceability
*Provide a screenshot of a completed or open Pull Request (PR) on GitHub that clearly shows it is linked to a related development issue.*

[PASTE YOUR PULL REQUEST SCREENSHOT DIRECTLY HERE]

* **Caption:** [Write a brief sentence describing your PR and what issue it closes]

## 5. Merge Conflict Evidence

You must engineer **three merge conflicts**, each triggered by a **different cause** from those covered in the lecture. For Conflict 1, document the full resolution lifecycle. For Conflicts 2 and 3, provide the conflict marker screenshot and identify the cause.

> **Marks:** Conflict 1 full chronology (2 marks) · Conflict 2 (1 mark) · Conflict 3 (1 mark) · All three use distinct causes (1 mark) = **5 marks total**

---

### Conflict 1 — Full Chronology

**What cause did you use?** [Name the type of conflict cause from the lecture]

#### Step 1: Generating the Clash
*Screenshot showing the merge attempt and the conflict warning.*

[PASTE SCREENSHOT OF ATTEMPTED MERGE / TERMINAL WARNING HERE]

* **Caption:** [Describe which two branches collided and the warning received]

#### Step 2: Inside the Code Editor (Conflict Markers)
*Screenshot showing the raw, unresolved conflict markers (`<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) in your editor.*

[PASTE SCREENSHOT OF RAW CONFLICT MARKERS HERE]

* **Caption:** [Explain what caused the dispute and your reasoning for the final version]

#### Step 3: Resolution & Clean Merge
*Screenshot of your clean Git history or completed PR showing the conflict was resolved and merged.*

[PASTE SCREENSHOT OF CLEAN RESOLUTION HERE]

* **Caption:** [Describe the final state after resolution]

### Conflict 2 — Different Cause

**What cause did you use?** [Name the type of conflict cause — must be different from Conflict 1]

**Why does this cause trigger a conflict?** [1–2 sentences explaining the mechanism]

[PASTE SCREENSHOT OF CONFLICT MARKERS FOR CONFLICT 2 HERE]

* **Caption:** [Brief description of the conflicting branches and file]

### Conflict 3 — Different Cause

**What cause did you use?** [Name the type of conflict cause — must be different from Conflicts 1 and 2]

**Why does this cause trigger a conflict?** [1–2 sentences explaining the mechanism]

[PASTE SCREENSHOT OF CONFLICT MARKERS FOR CONFLICT 3 HERE]

* **Caption:** [Brief description of the conflicting branches and file]
